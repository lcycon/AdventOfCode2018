Advent of Code 2018
===================

My solutions to the Advent of Code problems. I make no promises about the quality, but it tends to be okay-ish.

### Haskell

These can be run generally as such:

```
# In haskell directory
stack build AdventOfCode2018:d<day>
cat ../inputs/d<day>.txt | stack exec d<day>
```
